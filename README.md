# stock-prediction-comparing-4-regression-models
A stock prediction project using a Linear,Lasso,KNN and Ridge Regression
We compare the Room Mean Square Errors of the $ models along with the confidence scores

I combined some code from the two sources below:

[Vincent Tatan's](https://towardsdatascience.com/@vincentkernn) '2-minutes-stocks-analysis-with-pandas-and-scikit-learn'-> https://towardsdatascience.com/in-12-minutes-stocks-analysis-with-pandas-and-scikit-learn-a8d8a7b50ee7

[repollo](https://github.com/repollo) stock-prediction repo which I forked -> https://github.com/repollo/stock-prediction .

Thank you both for these great,helpful demos
